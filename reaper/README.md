# ðŸ’€ Emerge Reaper

Reaper is an SDK that uses production data for detecting dead code.

## Features

- Automatically detect and delete dead code in production.
- View statistics on real-world code usage.
- (Upcoming) Automated code deletion.

## Quickstart (~10 min)

### Setup Emerge Gradle plugin

Add the Emerge Gradle plugin to your application's `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("com.emergetools.android")
}

emerge {
  // Emerge uses the EMERGE_API_TOKEN env variable by default, so no need to set env explicitly
  apiToken.set(System.getenv("EMERGE_API_TOKEN"))

  reaper {
    enabled.set(true)
  }
}
```

You must set `enabled` to be `true` for reaper to work properly. Behind the scenes, the Emerge
Gradle plugin will instrument your code to drop breadcrumbs that Reaper can use to detect dead code
when this property is set.

**Emerge recommends enabling reaper on any release build run.**

See [gradle-plugin](../gradle-plugin/README.md) for more information.

### Add Reaper SDK

Add the Reaper SDK to your application's `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin

dependencies {
  implementation("com.emergetools.reaper:reaper:<latest_version>")
}
```

### Upload a release build

Emerge needs a valid release AAB to generate a list of all possible classes within your app.

```shell
./gradlew :app:emergeUploadReleaseAAB
```

An Emerge url will be printed to the console. Navigate to this URL as you'll need it for the next
step!

### Initialize Reaper

In your app's Application class, call `Reaper.init()`, passing the application instance and your
Reaper API key.

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    Reaper.init(this, "<YOUR_REAPER_API_KEY>")
  }
}
```

You can find your org's Reaper API key by visiting the Reaper page in the Emerge sidebar from the
url printed by the previous step.

### Release your app with Reaper

That's it! Build and ship your release app with Reaper enabled to start detecting dead code.

As reports come in, Emerge's Reaper UI will show unused code from real user reports. We recommend
waiting a few days after a release before acting on the data to ensure enough time for a wide range
of user sessions to have used your app.

## How it works

Emerge Reaper uses production data to detect dead code by determining what code is used at runtime.

It works by instrumenting code using our Gradle plugin, which instruments class initialization
functions. Upon a class being initialized, Emerge will mark that class as used in an in-memory
store. This marking is done by recording a hash of the class name, so no actual class names are
recorded.

Upon a user backgrounding the application, Emerge will send the list of hashes of used classes to
the Emerge backend. Emerge will then process each report received, marking classes as used if any
user session reports that class being used.

## Size impact

Emerge's Reaper SDK is very small and has a negligible impact on your app's size.

The instrumentation adds class intitialization logging to your app's code, so actual size impact is
a function of how many classes are in your app.

TODO: Ryan/Hector
In testing, Emerge has seen an app of XX classes increase ~XX KB in size.

## Performance impact

TODO: Ryan/Hector
From testing with a variety of apps, we've found that the performance impact of Reaper is
negligible.

## Data impact

## Load

Reaper has been in production in numerous apps with hundreds of millions of users since 2023.

Emerge can easily handle reports for these apps, sometimes containing tens of thousands of class
usage reports.

## Releasing

### Releasing a new version

1. Update the `emerge-reaper` version in `/gradle/libs.versions.toml`
2. Update the `/reaper/CHANGELOG.md`
3. `gt c -am "Prepare for Reaper release X.Y.Z"` (where X.Y.Z is the version set in step 1)
4. `gt ss`
5. Get PR approved and merge
6. Create a new release on GitHub
7. Tag version `reaper-vX.Y.Z`
8. Release title `Reaper vX.Y.Z`
9. Paste the content from `/reaper/CHANGELOG.md` as the description

The `reaper-release` workflow will automatically publish the new version to Sonatype upon new
release publish.

From there, the release will need to be promoted to the main repository from the Sonatype UI.
