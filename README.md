your Android project.

See [gradle-plugin](./gradle-plugin/README.md) for more information.

## üèé Performance

Emerge offers tooling for performance testing custom startup and UI tests.

Emerge tests on real, physical devices and handles variance control, statistical measurements and
more to ensure you get 99% accurate performance measurements.

allowing you to focus on building beautiful UI components.
